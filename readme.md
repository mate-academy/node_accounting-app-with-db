# Accounting app (with Node.js and PostgreSQL)
Take the Accounting app from prev lesson and use PostgreSQL as a storage

- Implement CRUD page to manage categories

Data types:
User {
  id: number, // is puted by PostgreSQL itself, is primary key
  name: string,
}

Expense {
  id: number, // is puted by PostgreSQL itself, is primary key
  userId: number,
  title: string,
  spentAt: new Date(),
  amount: number,
  category: string,
  note: string,
}

The following table shows overview of the Rest APIs that will be exported:

GET /users get all Users
GET /users/:id get User by id
POST /users add new User (name string field is required)
PATCH /users/:id update User by id (name string field is required)
